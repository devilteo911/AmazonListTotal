# Amazon List Total

Have you ever wondered to know the total of your Amazon wishlist? Amazon is a fantastic online warehouse with plenty of function but it lacks of one of the simplest but yet one of the most useful one: the sum of the prices of all the items in a list. This python notebook is about that, a companion of the buyer.

## Usage

- Download the repo
- Open the jupyter notebook with Visual Studio Code/Google Colab (recommended)
- Run the whole code
- A text box will appear, then copy&paste the wishlist link (e.g.  https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/#######?&sort=default)
- Done
